# Pipe Project

One of the core components of the Pipe product is the "trading view", where merchants
on our platform are able to sell their revenue contracts. The core controls for the trading view are the slider and the table.

Usually a merchant interacts with one or the other, but their state is shared.
A user can select the amount they wish to Pipe by dragging the slider (and the slider
automatically selects SaaS contracts to Pipe), or manually by selecting individual contracts on the table. Your objective is to implement the slider and table to the best of your ability within the timeline.
